# CS-Mobile-Apps Group Project To-Do List:
Inside the SnakeGame.java file if you Ctrl-F search for NOTE I have comments on some parts of the code we probably need to replace

-Design the main menu

-Replace their sound effects with our own (The current ones are in the app/src/main/assets folder). Maybe add music too?

-Replace their images with our own (Ideally they should be the same resolutions and name as what they have)
  Possibly use a squirrel instead of a snake

-Create a background for the game canvas

-The high score they had doesn't do anything, maybe we can try and fix it

-We might need to change their controls? Doesn't work well with mouse, we need to test it on an actual phone (Controls do not work well on actual phone, screen demensions are odd)

-Create tutorial fragment that shows at the start of the game?

-Create Pause Button?

-Create Game Over Screen and message? Maybe have an option to go back to the menu or restart? - Renee
